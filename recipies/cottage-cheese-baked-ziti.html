    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gone are the days when cottage cheese was just a bland diet food, filling up the scooped-out well of a cantaloupe. It's now used in, well, everything—whisked into eggs, blended into dips, added to sweet treats, and, in this recipe, swapped for ricotta. Why? It has a tangier flavor and packs more protein, making it a great upgrade to classic recipes.</p>
    <p>A few tips: You might question the amount of salt in the sauce, but don’t skimp—the pasta really needs it! I use Diamond Crystal kosher salt, which is less dense than Morton or fine salt. If using a heavier kosher salt like Morton, cut the amount to 3/4 tsp.; for fine sea salt or table salt, use half the amount that’s called for. If you don’t have a deep enough skillet, prepare the ziti up until you remove it from the heat and transfer to a lightly greased 13" x 9" baking dish, then proceed with the recipe as written.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 Tbsp.</strong> extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 tsp.</strong> crushed red pepper flakes <em>(optional)</em></li>
        <li><strong>1 lb.</strong> sweet or hot Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
        <li><strong>5 cups</strong> store-bought or homemade marinara sauce Kosher salt</li>
        <li><strong>1 (16-oz.)</strong> container full-fat cottage cheese</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 tsp.</strong> garlic powder</li>
        <li><strong>1 oz.</strong> Parmesan, finely grated <em>(about 1/2 cup)</em>, divided</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> finely chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li><strong>1 lb.</strong> ziti, rigatoni, or other tube-shaped pasta</li>
        <li><strong>2 cups</strong> water</li>
        <li><strong>12 oz.</strong> low-moisture mozzarella, shredded <em>(about 3 cups)</em>, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange a rack in upper third of oven; preheat to 450°. In a large (at least 12"), high-sided, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook sausage, breaking up into large pieces, until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in red pepper flakes (if using) and cook, stirring, until warmed through, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add marinara; season with 1 tsp. salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine cottage cheese, garlic powder, half of Parmesan, and half of parsley, mashing the curds as you stir; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Add ziti and water to skillet and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring so pasta doesn’t stick to bottom of skillet, until well combined, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, then fold in half of cottage cheese mixture and half of mozzarella, making sure to leave some pockets of cheese throughout.</li>
        <li>Dollop pasta with remaining cottage cheese mixture. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella and Parmesan over.</li>
        <li>Transfer to oven and bake until pasta is tender and bubbling, and cheese is golden and browned in spots, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. Top with remaining parsley.</li>
    </ol>
