    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If the way to a person’s heart is really through their stomach, then Delish’s own Marry Me Chicken is a must-cook for pretty much everyone. This one-pan wonder has it all: plenty of luscious creamy sauce, tender chicken, and flavor for days. Honestly, I get all starry-eyed just thinking about it. But what if I want a little extra protein with my Marry Me moment? Because this recipe is so good and the sauce is so magical, it’s easy to make protein-boosting adjustments.</p>
    <h3>Make protein-boosting swaps:</h3>
    <p>Swapping out our usual low-sodium chicken broth for chicken bone broth was easy. Adding cottage cheese to the sauce seemed like a no-brainer, but how do you keep the sauce silky smooth? Read on.</p>
    <h3>Bring out the blender:</h3>
    <p>I added a little extra bone broth to a blender along with heavy cream, cottage cheese, freshly grated Parmesan, and sun-dried tomatoes to create a smooth sauce. Adding some tomato paste added a little acidity and gave the sauce a rosy hue.</p>
    <h3>Use quick-cooking chicken cutlets:</h3>
    <p>Because I’m adding a piece of equipment to the recipe, I want to make sure the rest of the recipe is as streamlined and easy as possible. Thin chicken cutlets, dusted with flour and Italian seasoning, are golden brown and cooked through in about 10 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Finish & enjoy:</h3>
    <p>Garlic and crushed red pepper flakes are sautéed in a little butter until fragrant. Then return the chicken and the blended sauce to the skillet, add fresh basil, and just 5 minutes later, dinner is served. Make crusty bread, a green salad, or cooked pasta or quinoa to complete the meal, and just wait for the declarations of love to begin.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong> chicken bone broth</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> heavy cream</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> whole milk cottage cheese</li>
        <li><strong>2 Tbsp.</strong> chopped sun-dried tomatoes <em>(from about 4 tomato halves)</em></li>
        <li><strong>2 Tbsp.</strong> finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp.</strong> tomato paste</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li><strong>4</strong> <em>(6-oz.)</em> boneless, skinless chicken cutlets</li>
        <li><strong>2 Tbsp.</strong> all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp.</strong> Italian seasoning</li>
        <li><strong>2 Tbsp.</strong> extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li><strong>1 Tbsp.</strong> unsalted butter</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 tsp.</strong> crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li><strong>1/2</strong> cup fresh basil leaves, torn, plus more for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, puree broth, cream, cottage cheese, tomatoes, Parmesan, and tomato paste until smooth; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Pat chicken dry; season all over with salt and black pepper. Sprinkle with flour and Italian seasoning, pressing with your fingers to adhere.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Working in batches if needed, cook chicken, turning halfway through, until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and let rest 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In same skillet over medium-low heat, melt butter. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring and scraping browned bits from bottom of skillet, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Return chicken and any accumulated juices to skillet. Pour sauce over. Add basil and cook, spooning sauce over chicken, until sauce has slightly thickened, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Divide chicken among plates. Top with more Parmesan and basil.</li>
    </ol>
