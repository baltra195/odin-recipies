    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crispy chickpeas, cabbage slaw, and brown rice are topped 
        with more veggies and herbs and drizzled with creamy peanut 
        sauce for a satisfying meal that is both hearty and healthy. 
        Here's how to make it the best it can be:</p>
    <h3>The crispy chickpeas</h3>
    <p>Just a few minutes in hot oil transforms canned chickpeas into
         crispy browned nuggets that are perfect for topping any 
         salad or bowl you like, or just eating as a snack. Tip: 
         Make sure to drain, rinse, and dry the chickpeas as 
         thoroughly as possible before adding them to the hot oil; 
         any moisture left might make the oil spit!</p>
    <h3>The peanut sauce</h3>
    <p>For me, the secret to the best creamy peanut sauce is freshly
         grated garlic and ginger. The sharp fresh aromatics really 
         balance the deep savory quality of the peanut butter and 
         the soy sauce and completely transform the flavor of the 
         sauce. While you can finely chop the garlic and ginger in 
         a pinch, I prefer to grate with a microplane: This helps 
         to release the flavor of the aromatics more, as well as 
         helping them meld into the sauce more seamlessly.</p>
    <h3>Make ahead & storage</h3>
    <p>The peanut sauce can be made up to 3 days ahead; cover and 
        store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Both 
        the red cabbage slaw and crispy chickpeas are best fresh, 
        but if you would like to meal-prep these bowls, you can fry 
        the chickpeas and cut the cabbage and store both separately 
        in airtight containers until you are ready to build your 
        bowls.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Peanut Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1</strong> garlic clove, grated</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 tsp.</strong> grated peeled ginger</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> all-natural creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li><strong>3 Tbsp.</strong> fresh lime juice <em>(from 1 to 2 limes)</em></li>
        <li><strong>2 Tbsp.</strong> reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li><strong>1 Tbsp.</strong> honey</li>
        <li><strong>2 tsp.</strong> toasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Chickpeas & Bowls</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 (14.5-oz)</strong> can chickpeas, drained, rinsed</li>
        <li><strong>2 Tbsp.</strong> neutral oi</li>
        <li><strong>3/4 tsp.</strong> kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li><strong>1 Tbsp.</strong> grated peeled ginger</li>
        <li><strong>1/4</strong> head of red cabbage (about 6 oz.), shredded or finely chopped <em>(about 3 cups)</em></li>
        <li><strong>2 Tbsp.</strong> finely chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for serving</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> medium carrot, shredded</li>
        <li><strong>3 cups</strong> cooked brown rice</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> roasted peanuts, chopped</li>
        <li><strong>4</strong> lime wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Peanut Sauce</h4></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk garlic, ginger, peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, honey, and sesame oil. Add warm water, 1 tsp. at a time, until desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> Sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><h4>Chickpeas & Bowls</h4></li>
        <ol>
            <li>On a large clean kitchen towel or paper towels, spread out chickpeas. Top with a second clean towel and gently press to remove as much moisture as possible from chickpeas. (If you can, pick off and discard as many chickpea skins as possible; this will help the chickpeas crisp up better.)</li>
            <li>In a large, deep, heavy skillet (preferably at least 2" deep) over medium heat, heat oil. Add chickpeas; season with 1/2 tsp. kosher salt and gently toss to coat. Spread chickpeas in a single layer and cook, tossing occasionally, until browned and slightly crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. (The chickpeas may cause the oil to spit, so use a splatter screen if you have one!)</li>
            <li>Add garlic and ginger and continue to cook, tossing constantly, until chickpeas are crispy all over and garlic and ginger are lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer chickpea mixture to a clean plate.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, toss cabbage, cilantro, and 1/4 tsp. salt.</li>
            <li>Spread 3/4 cup rice among bowls. Top with cabbage mixture, cucumbers, carrots, and chickpeas. Sprinkle with peanuts and more cilantro; drizzle with peanut sauce. Serve with lime wedges alongside.</li>
        </ol>
